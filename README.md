# Introduction
I-Attend is a smart attendance recording and maintaining software, that uses both Web and 
App interfaces to record and maintain attendance using modern technologies such as face 
recognition, geolocation tracing, QR codes.
I-Attend automates the task of attendance recording and maintaining up to large extent. It 
reduces the time required to capture attendance and also reduces the burden from the one 
taking the attendance.
This software is intended to be used by the teachers or professors of Schools and colleges, 
but can also be used by other organizations after applying some modifications and changes 
on the software.
